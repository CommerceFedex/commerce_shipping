 * - title: the human readable title of the shipping service
 * - shipping_method: the machine-name of the shipping method the service is for
 * - callbacks: an array of callback function names with the following keys:
 *   - rate: the function used to generate the price array for the base rate of

 *     ($shipping_service, $order)
 * Values for the following keys are optional:
 * - display_title: the title used for the service on the front end; defaults to
 *   the title
 * - description: a basic description of the service
 * - rules_component: boolean indicating whether or not a default Rules
 *   component should be created to be used for enabling this service on a given
 *   order; defaults to TRUE
 * - price_component: the name of the price component used in the unit price of

 *   - details_form_submit: the function used to perform any additional
 *     processing required on a shipping line item in light of the details form;
 *     details form submit callbacks are passed three parameters,
